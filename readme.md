This is a simple web-based interpreter for the new language called LED, which is designed by Dr. Nelson Rushton and implemented by Dr. Qianji Zheng. The github repo is at https://github.com/qianji/LED

The LED interpreter, implemented using python, is host on a server. I used node.js to set up a web service interface for the interpreter and have a browser front end to interact with it.
